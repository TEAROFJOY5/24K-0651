Start
Declare num1, num2, num3,Greater_num
Print " Enter first number"
Print " Enter second number"
Print " Enter third number"
  if Calc num1>num2
	then Print num1 is greater than num2.
	num1==Greater_num
  else Calc num2>num1
	then Print num2 is greater than num1.
	num2==Greater_num
if Greater_num>num3
	then Print GreaterNum is the Greatest number of all the three number.
else 
	Print num3 is the Greatest Number of all the three number.
End


Question 2
Start 
Declare n=1,N=4,M=7,sum
Calc sum=12
Print The sum of the number is 12.
End


Question 3
Start
Declare c,n,N,operator.
Print "Enter First number"
Print "Enter Second number"
Print "Enter an operator."
 if operator= '+'
   then Calc c=n+N
   Print " sum of first and second number is "
 else if operator= '-'
    print Calc c=n-N
   Print " difference of first and second number is "
 else 
    Print " You have entrr an invalid number "
End




Question 4
Take two numbers n and N
To check n is divisible by N
when n%N is zero.
Then n is dividsible by N.
Otherwise n is not divisible by N.

Question 5

Ask the user to enter any number between 1 to 12.
When user enter 1, output the month is January
When user enter 2, output the month is Febrary.
When user enter 3, output the month is March.
When user enter 4, output the month is April.
When user enter 5, output the month is May.
When user enter 6, output the month is June.
When user enter 7, output the month is July.
When user enter 8, output the month is August.
When user enter 9, output the month is September.
When user enter 10, output the month is October.
Wher user enter 11, output the month is November.
When user enter 12 output the month is December.


Question 6
You will take two numbers as input from the user.
After this take one of these operator (+,-,/,*) as input from the user.
After having numbers and operator as input, now operation will be perform.
At last, output the result of operation to the user.

  
Start
Show the mathematical operation symbols +,-,/,* and %
Print Please select the operation symbol
Print Enter first_number
Print Enter second_number
if the operation symbol is +''
	Calc Ans= first_number + second_number
if the operation symbol is -''
	Calc Ans= first_number - second_number
if the operation symbol is '*' 
	Calc Ans= first_number * second_number
if the operation symbol is '/' And IF second_number is not zero
	then Calc Ans= first_number / second_number
if the operation symbol is '%' 
	Calc Ans= first_number % second_number
Print the answer
End
